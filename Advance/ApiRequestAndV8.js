// 
// API stands for “application programming interface.” An API is essentially a set of rules that dictate 
// how two machines talk to each other. Some examples of API-based interactions include a 
// cloud application communicating with a server, servers pinging each other, 
// or applications interacting with an operating system.
// 
// we take api's which are big codes and use "Json formatter" to interpret this api code.
// 
// Before fetch() which is used to take apis or files from different environment or database.
// We used to take Xmlhttprequests() there are different types as well. 
// 
// xmlhttprequest is AJAX(Asychronous javascript and XML) related programming 
// 
// there are Xmlhttprequest.readystate() which has five types of states.
// srno | Value | State
//      |   0   | UNSENT = here client has been created but open() function is not called.
//      |   1   | OPENED = here open() is called meanns request is sent but data is not received.
//      |   2   | HEADERS RECEIVED = here send() is called means data is given but not in systematically with no status.
//      |   3   | LOADING = here responese are aken and its data.
//      |   4   | DONE = operation is done.
// 
// we always write xmlhttprequest() as a new object like "const Objectname = new Xmlhttprequest()"
// to request we use Objectname.open("inside we have write method like= GET,POST,PUT,PUSH for the files",
                      //             And need to mention a variable who has url in a string input.)
