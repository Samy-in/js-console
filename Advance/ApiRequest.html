0	UNSENT	Client has been created. open() not called yet.
1	OPENED	open() has been called.
2	HEADERS_RECEIVED	send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
3	LOADING	Downloading; responseText holds partial data.
4	DONE	The operation is complete.

            // Now to do work on specific state like suppose at stage 4 we have to print a variable so that variable is 
            // treated as a response text from system.
            if (RequestData.readyState === 4) {
               // we are storing this responsetext so that we can access the objects inside it like followers,files etc
               // but huge problem is system always send the response in string form so we have to convert it in object form
               // to get access to further functions.
               // so we use JSON.parse() which converts it in object, there are other methods too like convert to number so we
               // use Number.parse()

          RequestData.send() // Now if write anything it available in console but if we want to check the values like above mentioned tables
   // We use onreadystatechange() to trace readystate() values while requesting and
   // it requires a function in which its value is carried.
